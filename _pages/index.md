# Hello Charlie!

## Hello client ##

This is a Bootstrap site with Jekyll!

### An h3 header ###

This is some code:

``System.out.println("Hello World!");``

* * *

$$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \, dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)
